There are two branches in this repository. It is because I did third(optional) section in two ways.


To open app on a Master branch in terminal write:
1. npm install
2. npm install sass
3. npm install react-countup
4. npm install react-intersection-observer --save


To open app on a section3WithCarousel branch in terminal write:

1-4. all the same from above

5. npm i react-spring-3d-carousel 

After that write: 'npm run dev' and app start.
